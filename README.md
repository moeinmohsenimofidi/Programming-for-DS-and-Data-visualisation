<h2>this repository contains two separate project:</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Python Project</h3><br><a>In this project I want to work on a dataset about the number of Hyundai cars that have been sold in recent years. I collected this data set from <a href="kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> website and attached it besides this paper. Fortunately, this dataset doesn’t need to clean because its author did it before, but it contains three object columns (model,transmission, fuel type) that need to encode them before any manipulating on the whole dataset, I will try to do this by using library’s and algorithms such as <strong>OneHotEncoder</strong> and <strong>LabelEncoder</strong>.
In this project i encounter with this question and problem that which features of this data set has the greater impact on the car’s prices, so I will try to find the best feature which has a stronger correlation with the price, so I will use the <strong>standard correlation coefficient f_regression</strong> and <strong>SelectKBest</strong> .
I want to create the prediction ML that will be able to predict the price of the Hyundai cars at the end of this project, so I will started to split the data set to training set, testing set and validate them .in the next step and work on them by using different Machin learning algorithms and evaluating the performance by using <strong>MSE</strong> and <strong>R2</strong> modules.
As I explain before we want to predict the price of the cars, I have label in our project and for this reason I can classify it as a supervised system, so I can use regression’s methods in this project.<a></li>
